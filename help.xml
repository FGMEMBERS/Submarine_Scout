 <!-- Handling instructions. -->
 <line>Take-off
 
 1. Weigh-off (W) a couple of times until weight on ground (w) is less than 10 lbs.
    Small non-rigid airships often take-off slightly heavy.
 2. Tell the ground crew to let go (Y).
 3. Adjust static trim and envelope pressure if needed (q/Q, a/A).
    During take-off the trim should be neutral while in flight the airship
    should be trimmed slightly nose heavy
    for pitch stability at high speed (i.e. above 30 MPH).
 4. Start the engine (magnetos on + s).
 5. Take-off is done at full throttle. Use some elevator to
    keep the nose high.
 6. Maintain pitch trim and envelope pressure by careful use of the ballonet
    valves (avoid permanent elevator deflections).
    The rudder needs constant attention since airships are unstable in yaw.
 7. Remember that the secondary effect of elevators and rudder are quite strong.
    Full elevator up might push the whole airship down at low speed.
 
 Landing
 1. Check static condition: slightly heavy is better than light.
 2. Prepare the ground crew (U).
 3. Approach is against the wind, low (~150ft) and slow.
 4. Aim to arrive between the handling parties, below 100ft and with very low speed.
 5. The ground crew uses the handling guys to secure the ship.

 Envelope pressure and static trim management
   Monitor and maintain the envelope pressure at between 15 - 25mm water (=
   the height difference between the outer and inner fluid in the manometers).
   The ballonet valves are used to keep the pressure and the static trim in
   line. Opening the ballonet valves let air out of the ballonets.
   Air at pressure to inflate the ballonets is constantly taken from the
   propeller slip stream.

 Moving the ground crew
   The ground crew can be moved via Alt + click.
