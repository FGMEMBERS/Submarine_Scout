 <!-- Handling instructions. -->
 <line>Take-off
 
 1. Weigh-off (W) a couple of times until weight on ground (w) is less than 10 lbs.
    Small non-rigid airships often take-off slightly heavy.
 2. Tell the ground crew to let go (Y).
 3. Adjust static trim and envelope pressure if needed (q/Q, a/A).
    During take-off the trim should be neutral while in flight the airship should be trimmed slightly nose heavy
    for pitch stability at high speed (i.e. above 30 mph).
 4. Start the engine (magnetos on + s).
 5. Take-off is done at full throttle. Use some elevator to
    keep the nose high.
 6. Stay in control by careful use of elevator and rudder.
    The rudder needs constant attention since airships are unstable in yaw.
 7. Remember that the secondary effect of elevators and rudder are quite strong.
    Full elevator up might push the whole airship down at low speed.
 
 Landing
 1. Check static condition: slightly heavy is better than light.
 2. Prepare the ground crew (U).
 3. Approach is against the wind, low (~150ft) and slow.
 4. Aim to arrive between the handling parties, below 100ft and with very low speed.
 5. The ground crew uses the handling guys to secure the ship.

 Moving the ground crew
   The ground crew can be placed via Alt + click.
