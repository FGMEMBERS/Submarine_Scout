 <!-- Handling instructions. -->
 <line>Take-off</line>
 <line></line>
 <line>1. Weigh-off (W) a couple of times until weight on ground (w) is less than 10 lbs.</line>
 <line>   Small non-rigid airships often take-off slightly heavy.</line>
 <line>2. Tell the ground crew to let go (Y).</line>
 <line>3. Adjust static trim and envelope pressure if needed (q/Q, a/A).</line>
 <line>   During take-off the trim should be neutral while in flight the airship should be trimmed slightly nose heavy</line>
 <line>   for pitch stability at high speed (i.e. above 30 mph).</line>
 <line>4. Start the engine (magnetos on + s).</line>
 <line>5. Take-off is done at full throttle. Use some elevator to</line>
 <line>   keep the nose high.</line>
 <line>6. Stay in control by careful use of elevator and rudder.</line>
 <line>   The rudder needs constant attention since airships are unstable in yaw.</line>
 <line>7. Remember that the secondary effect of elevators and rudder are quite strong.</line>
 <line>   Full elevator up might push the whole airship down at low speed.</line>
 <line></line>
 <line>Landing</line>
 <line>1. Check static condition: slightly heavy is better than light.</line>
 <line>2. Prepare the ground crew (U).</line>
 <line>3. Approach is against the wind, low (~150ft) and slow.</line>
 <line>4. Aim to arrive between the handling parties, below 100ft and with very low speed.</line>
 <line>5. The ground crew uses the handling guys to secure the ship.</line>
